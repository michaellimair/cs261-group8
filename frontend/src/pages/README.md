# Pages

All pages should have the same name as their routes. For example, if you are making a page for `/login`, the file name should be `login.tsx`.

The name of the component inside the page should follow a convention of `PagenamePage.tsx`. For example, the aforementioned login page should have a component name of `LoginPage`.
