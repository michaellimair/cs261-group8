# ***REMOVED*** Frontend App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner with coverage testing.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Internationalization (i18n)

**DO NOT** place any plain text strings within component text files. If you have anything that resembles plain text (sentences, words, phrases), please add them to the `src/i18n/[locale].json` file so that it will support further localization.

Localization is something that has been implemented from the ground up so that no future extra effort is needed.

If you feel like it, feel free to add a locale to your own liking. For file name formatting of the locale file, please visit the reference [here](https://www.i18next.com/how-to/faq#how-should-the-language-codes-be-formatted).

## Routing

All routing is done with React Router v6. Please refer to the [new documentation](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview), as a Google search might lead you to the old version (v5) which has a different set of APIs.
